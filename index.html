            <big>What is chemistry ?</big>
            <p>All of the objects around you—this book, your pen or pencil, and the things of
               nature such as rocks, water, and plant and animal substances—constitute the matter of the universe. Each of the particular kinds of matter, such as a certain kind of paper or plastic or metal, is referred to as a material. We can define chemistry as the science of the composition and structure of materials and of the changes that materials undergo.
           </p>
           <big><u>Definiton</u>:</big>
           <p>
               Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with the study the study of matter its structure, composition , properties and the changes it undergoes.It involves the study of material substances that occurs on earth and in the universe. Other branches of science are biology and physics.

           <big>What is matter</big>
           <p>
               Things regarded as <i>matter</i> sorround us. <i>Matter is everything that has mass and can occupies space.</i> The houses we live in, the clothes we wear, add the food we eat, the air we breath, the water we drink, stone, wood, plants animals, are all example of matter.

                ATOM: An atom can be defined as;
                <ul>
                    <li>the smallest particle or part of an element that can ever exist.</li>
                    <li>the smallest particle or part of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction</li>
                    <li>the smallest indivisible particle or part of an element that can take part in a chemical reaction.</li>
                </ul>      
            </p>
            <p>
               Atoms were discovered by <b><i>John Dalton in 1808</i></b> and are usually represented by symbols.
    <p>
        A symbol is one or two letters that are used to represent atom of an element. A symbol can be the first letter of the name of an element and is always a capital letter e.g. hydrogen, H or the first two letters of the name of an element in which the first letter is a capital letter while the second one is a small letter e.g. helium, He. It can also be the first letter and the third letter e.g. chlorine, Cl. The same rule is applied to elements with Greek or Latin name in which their symbols are derived e.g. potassium (kalium), K, sodium (natrium), Na etc.
    <P>
        <b>MOLECULE:</b> A molecule contains two or more atoms chemically combined together. The atoms can be of the same elements e.g. O2, N2 etc or from different elements e.g. CO2, H2O (known as compounds)
    <p>
        <big><b>ATOMIC STRUCTURE:</b></big>
    <p>
        An atom consists of a central nucleus surrounded by shells situated at different energy levels containing electrons. The nucleus which is situated at centre of the atom contains two particles namely proton and neutron (known as nucleons). The mass of the atom is concentrated at centre of the atom in the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus determines the physical properties of the atoms such as density, solubility, boiling point, melting point etc. The electrons on the other hand determine the chemical properties of the elements (because the electrons can be lost or gained). The nucleus was discovered by <b><i>Rutherford in 1911.</i></b>
    <p>
        <big><b>FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES OF AN ATOM</b></big>
    <p>
        An atom is made up of three particles namely proton, neutron and electron. These particles are called Fundamental particles or Sub – particles because they are found in all atoms of elements except hydrogen which contain proton and proton).

        <big><b>DISCOVERY OF FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES:</b></big>
    <p>
        <b>ELECTRONS:</b> Electrons were discovered by <b>J. J. Thomson in 1897</b> while investigating the conduction of electricity by gases at low pressure. They were first discovered as cathode rays or negatively charged particles by him.
        <p>
        <b>PROTON:</b> Protons were also were observed as positive rays by <b>J. J. Thomson</b> after electrons but were observed directly by <b>Ernest Rutherford in 1914</b> as positive charges when he bombarded various nuclei by alpha particles. Thus discovery of protons were credited to <b>Ernest Rutherford in 1920</b>.
        <p>
        <b>NEUTRON:</b> Neutrons were discovered by <b>James Chadwick in 1932</b> when he bombarded a thin sheet of beryllium with alpha particles using zinc sulphide screen.
        However the year of discovery of the particles may vary depending on the source.
    <p>
        <b>EXPERIMENTS THAT LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES OF AN ATOM</b>
    <p>
        The experiments includes;
    <p>
    <b>THOMSON DISCHARGE TUBE EXPERIMENT AND MILLIKAN OIL DROP EXPERIMENT</b>   
    <p>
        The two experiments led to the discovery of electrons.
    <p>
        <b>Thomson in 1897</b> measured the charge/mass ratio of cathode rays (negative particles) later called electrons during the experiment on the conduction of electricity by gases at low pressure in gas discharge tubes. He also found that the rays (electrons) are deflected toward the positive plate of the magnetic field. He also suggested that atom consists of positively charged particle in addition to the negatively charged particles, thus, making an atom to be electrically neutral. He also proposed a model for the atom which consists of electrons which are embedded in the positive charges.
    <p> 
        <b>R.  A. Millikan in 1909</b> carried out an Oil drop experiment in which he determined the charge of the electrons. He found the charge, q = mg/E = -1.60 X 10-19 coulombs (q = charge of electron and g = acceleration due to gravity, m = mass of the electron and E = applied voltage). The mass of an electron was found to be 9.09 X 10-28 g which is obtained by the expression
    <p>
        Mass of an electron = Charge of an electron (e)/(Charge/Mass)
                     = -1.60 X 10-19/-1.7 X108 = 9.09 X 10-28 g.
    <p>
        Further experiment by Thomson led to the discovery of positive rays travelling in opposite direction to the cathode rays but with larger mass than electrons. These positive rays were later observed to protons <i>in 1914 by Rutherford.</i>

    <p>
        <big><b>RUTHERFORD SCATTERING EXPERIMENT</b>
            <p>
        <i>Rutherford</i> and other scientists <i>Geiger and Marsden</i> carried out the alpha scattering experiment that led to the discovery of proton earlier detected by <i>Thomson.</i> They bombarded various nuclei with alpha (helium) particles such as gold and observed how they were scattered by observing flashes or light (Scintillation) as the alpha particles hit the zinc sulphide used as screen. The result of the experiment suggested that the alpha particles scattered ribbon must collide with part of the atom in which the positive charge and mass of the atom were concentrated i.e nucleus and electrons move round the nucleus. The positive charge are named proton by him. He compared his model with solar system in which electrons are orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun.

    <br/>
    <p>
        <big><b>CHADWICK ALPHA BOMBARDMENT EXPERIMENT</b></big>
        <p>
            James Chadwick (1932) bombarded beryllium with alpha particles and detected no resulting particles in order to find the evidence for neutral particles within the nucleus as proposed by Rutherford. However, on placing a wax screen close to the beryllium proton were detected. He explained this result by supposing that the alpha particle ejected neutral particles (called neutron) from beryllium atom.
    <p>
        <big><b>MODELS OF ATOM</b></big>
        <p>
            The discovery of fundamental particles led to the speculation about how these particles might be arranged to form neutral atoms. Therefore models of atoms suggests how the fundamental or sub – atomic particles are arranged if present. There are three models by which atoms were represented.
    <p>
        <big><b>J. J. Thomson’s Plum Pudding Model</b></big>
        <p>
            The model suggested that atoms contain electrons dotted about within a sphere of positive charges (or sphere of positively charged matter in which electrons are embedded).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        <big><b>Rutherford Model</b></big>
        <p>
        <i><b>Rutherford</b></i> described an atom to consist of positively charged core called nucleus where most of the mass of the atom is concentrated and the electrons move round the nucleus. He compared his model to the solar system with electron orbiting the nucleus like planet orbiting the sun.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        <big><b>Bohr Model</b></big>
        <i><b>Neil Bohr in 1913</b></i> suggested an atom to contain a minute nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons with electrons revolving around the nucleus in a circular orbit of definite quantum energy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        <big><b>FORMULA:</b></big>
        <p>
        A formula is used to represent a compound.
        <p>
        A formula can be obtained by exchanging the valency or number of charges or oxidation number of the species as subscript. For example
            <br/>
            <br/>
        <big><b>RELATIVE ATOMIC MASS (Ar)</b></big> 
        It is the average mass of various isotopes as they occur naturally in any quantity of the element. It can be obtained from the expression.
        <p>Relative Atomic Mass, Ar = 
            <p>% abundance of isotope A x its isotopic mass/ + 
                            <p>100 
            <p>% abundance of isotope B x its isotopic mass/ + 
                            <p>100 
            <p>% abundance of isotope C x its isotopic mass /+ ------ 
                <p>
                            100 
    <p>
        <big><b><i>Examples:</i></b></big> 
        <p>
            A sample of ordinary neon is found to consists of 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne isotopes in the percentages; 20Ne = 90.220C, 21Ne = 0.26% and 22Ne = 8.82%. Calculate the relative atomic mass of Neon. 
            Note: The top left values on the Ne are the isotopic masses. 
            Relative Atomic Mass,
        <p>
             Ar =   90.22/100 x 20 + 0.26/100 x 21 + 8.82/100 x 22 
             <p>
            = 1818.4 + 5.46 +94.04 = 20.18 
        <p>
            An element, X has two isotopes 2010X and 2210X in the ratio of 1:3
            <p> 
            What is the Relative Atomic Mass, (Ar) of X ?
            <p>
            - The % (percentage abundance) should be calculated before applying the formula.
            <p> 
            Therefore, Total ratio = 1+3 = 4
            <p> 
            For 2010X = ¼ x 100 = 25% 
            <p>
            For 2210X = ¾ x 100 = 75% 
            <p>
            Therefore Ar = 25/100 x 20 + 75/100 x 22 = 21.5 
            <p>
            Calculate the Relative Atomic Mass of chlorine 
            <p>given the following data. 
            For 3517Cl = 75% and 3717Cl = 25% 
            <p>
            Therefore: Ar = 75/100 x 35 + 25/100 x 37 = 35.5

        <big><b>MODERN ELECTRONIC THEORY OF ATOMS: ELECTRON CONFIGURATION</b></big>
        <p>
        Electronic configuration is define as the arrangement of electrons of an atom.
        <p>
        Types of arrangement:
        <p>
        i). Using main energy levels (i.e K, L, M, N shells) in the Bohr model of the atom in  
        which each shell can accommodate 2n2 electrons.
        <p>
        K shell: 2electrons, L shell: 8 electrons, M shell: 18 electrons and N shell: 32 electrons
        But for the first 20 elements the 3rd shell cannot accommodate more than 8 electrons
        <p>
        Na : 2, 8, 1
        <p>
        K: 2, 8,8,1
        <p>
        while for elements with atomic number greater than 20, then the extra electron enters the 3rd shell until maximum of 18 is obtained.
        <p>
        Sc : 2, 8, 9, 2
        <p>
        Fe: 2, 8,14,2
        <p>
        Zn: 2, 8, 18, 2
        <p>
        ii). Using sub – shells.
        <p>
        Sub – shells are also called orbitals or Sub – energy levels.
        <p>
        An orbital is a place or region where an electron can be found or orbitals are places or 
        regions where the probability of finding an electron is very high.
        <p>
        There are 4 (four) different types of orbitals; s, p, d and f.
        <p>
        <b>Number of electrons each orbital can accommodate:</b>
        <p>
        s orbital: 2 electrons, p orbitals: 6 electrons, d orbitals: 10 electrons and f orbitals: 14 electrons.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
    <big><b>AUFBAU PRINCIPLE:</b></big>
        <p>
            The principle states that orbitals of an atom are arranged in an increasing order of energy with orbitals of lower energy being occupied by electrons first before those of higher energy.
            <p>
            The orbitals are arranged as follows:

        The orbitals are arranged from the tail to the head of the arrow (after drawing 7 parallel lines through the ns). Thus the orbitals are arranged as 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s ..
    <p>
        Examples
    <p>
        H: 1s1, He: 1s2, Li: 1s22s1, Na: 1s22s22p63s1
        Sc: 1s22s22p63s23p63d14s2   
        Try: 18Ar, 19K, 20Ca, 26Fe, 30Zn and 31Ga

    <big><b>Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity:</b></big>
    <p>
        The rule states that degenerate orbitals (orbital in the same energy level) are occupied by single electrons before pairing begins. Example;
        <p>
        P3

    <big><b>Pauli’s Exclusion Principle:</b></big>
    <p>
        No two electrons in an atom can have all the four quantum numbers same or identical; however two electrons in the same orbital can have same values of n, l, Ml but differ in their spin.
